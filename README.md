It used API and tested it with the Postman program. I used state management "Bloc". It used the DIO package for handling API. there is form validation. It used the bottom navigation bar to navigate between screens. and I used a search screen that you can search for any product existing in API. and It used the favorites screen and that screen was related to the products screen which you can click on the like it icon of the product and this product can add or remove it simultaneously like as what is happened when it used realtime database.
