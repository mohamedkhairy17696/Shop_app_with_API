# shop_application
In this project, I used API and tested API with the Postman program. I used state management "Bloc". By using API in this app I get, post, update, delete data. I used the DIO package for handling API. and in this app, there is form validation. In this app, I used the bottom navigation bar to navigate between screens. and I used a search screen that you can search for any product you need it. and I used the favorites screen and that screen was related to the product screen which you can click on the "love" icon on the product screen and this product simultaneously be in the favorites screen and you can remove it also from the favorites screen.
